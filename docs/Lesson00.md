# **Lesson 00** - Introduction and Motivation

During my last semester at school, I took a course on Operating Systems which, although very interesting, left more questions than answers. I wanted to know if it was possible to build an actual operating system, so one day after class I asked the professor who told me it wasn’t feasible and that getting even the most basic operating system would be too demanding of a task.

That answer was unsatisfying to me, so I did my own research which led me to find a handful of posts from people who managed to write an operating system for the Raspberry Pi from scratch. Fortunately, I had one laying around so I immediately got to work on reading others’ tutorials and playing around on my own. Although I found lots of interesting resources, I felt like most of the tutorials were either dated, skipped over key parts, or made otherwise confusing decisions for me to understand. So, I wanted to combine the best aspects of all the resources out there while adding in my own direction which has led me to creating this tutorial.

Although I’m just getting started on writing these, by the time they are finished, I hope they can be of value to anybody else who is either interested in OS development or, like me, had so many unanswered curious questions after taking an OS course.
